This is the Serenevy family cookbook. Published for fun and as a sample LaTeX
cookbook document.


Contributions
-------------

This is our personal cookbook, as such, I'm not looking for (or likely to accept)
contribitions -- unless you come over and cook your contribution for me. However,
feel free to fork this repository and use or delete these recipes as you like.
Attribution within forks is neither expected nor required.
