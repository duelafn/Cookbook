  Fry rice briefly in a bit of oil with seasonings. Add stock and 2~cups water. Bring
  to boil, then simmer on low for 15 minutes.

  Halve zucchini length-wise and optionally scoop out seeds. Rub with oil and
  sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast at 450\degF, cut sides down, on top rack for
  15--20 minutes.

  Make pico de gallo from chopped tomato, cilantro, and squeeze of lime.

  Make avocado crema with guacamole, 3~\oz sour cream, lime zest, squeeze of lime
  juice, and just enough water to make it drizzleable.

  Once done, flip zucchini, spoon some rice (just a bit, the rest of the rice can
  just go directly on the plates) into boats and sprinkle with pepper jack. Broil
  until cheese melts and browns slightly (a couple minutes).

  Plate with rice under boats. Sprinkle pico and drizzle avocado sauce and dollop
  with sour cream.
