  ``Quarter'' one whole chicken, saving the backbone and any bits
  for~\reciperef{Chicken Stock}. Cut up both sides of the backbone using kitchen
  shears. Cut leg and thigh off as a single piece. Cut bones on both sides of sternum
  with shears, trim back meat and pull out the sternum. Carve wings out of the
  breasts.

  Peel up skin and season chicken under the skin (except the wings),
  \reciperef{Blackening Seasoning} works well. Replace skin over the seasonings.

  Cook on grill, flipping every 5 minutes or so. Use instant read thermometer and
  pull off chicken at 165\degF. Wings will be done first (appetizers) at around
  15~minutes. Leg/thighs will be done around 20~minutes, and breasts will be done
  around 25--30~minutes.

  The two of us eat the dark meat with steamed broccoli and fried potatoes. We use
  the shredded chicken breasts for other meals later in the week (pot pie, tacos,
  \dots).
