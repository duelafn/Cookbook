  \begin{ingredients2}
    1 & cooked chicken breast\\
    \quarter \cup & teriyaki sauce
  \end{ingredients2}

  Prepare some rice and vegetables (or cook chicken in wok and stir-fry
  veggies after). Slice (cooked) chicken breast horizontally to produce two
  chicken ``patties''.

  Marinade chicken in sauce with hot peppers and ginger.

  Bring \textsl{non-stick} pan to temperature over medium-high heat,
  partially reduce teriyaki sauce. Once sauce starts to thicken, add
  chicken patties and cook until warm and sauce fully thickens, coating the
  chicken pieces. Goal is to reduce the sauce into a glaze and
  \textsl{carmelize the sugars} in the sauce. Serve with vegetables over
  rice.
