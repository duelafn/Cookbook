  \begin{ingredients2}
    1 \lb & egg noodles\\
    1--2 \lb & beef filet, top loin, or sirloin tip\\
    2 \T & oil\\
    1 large & (mild) onion\\
    3 \T & butter\\
    1 \lb & mushrooms\\
    2 \cups & beef broth (low salt)\\
    & Worshestershire\\
    & red wine (optional)\\
    1 \cup & sour cream\\
    2 \T & Dijon mustard\\
    & salt and pepper
  \end{ingredients2}

  Start boiling water for egg noodles.

  Sear meat in oil, remove from pan before cooked. The goal here is to
  sear and get goodies in the pan.

  Simmer onion in butter then add mushrooms and cook until liquid the
  mushrooms release evaporates.

  Add broth, Worshestershire, and red wine. Simmer 10 minutes to form a
  reduction. While reducing, cook egg noodles and slice steak into thin
  slices.

  Stir meat into sauce and remove from heat immediately or after no more
  than 1 or 2 minutes -- residual heat should finish cooking the beef.
  Allow to cool briefly.

  Stir together sour cream, mustard, salt, and pepper in the serving dish.
  Once meat and sauce are cool enough to not destroy the sour cream, stir
  into sour cream mixture then serve with egg noodles.
