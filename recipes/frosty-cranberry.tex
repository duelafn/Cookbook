  \begin{ingredients2}
    8 \oz & maraschino cherries\\
    16 \oz& jellied cranberry sauce\\
    3 \oz & cherry jello\\
    4 \T & lemon juice\\
    1 \cup & heavy cream\\
    3 \T & powdered sugar\\
    \fourth \t & lemon peel\\
    \third \cup & Light Miracle Whip
  \end{ingredients2}

  Keep syrup from cherries, chop cherries and set aside. Add water to syrup to make
  1\half~cups of liquid. Nuke or boil on stove then add jello. Stir to dissolve.

  In large mixing bowl place jello mix. Add cranberry sauce and 3~\T of the lemon
  juice. Beat until blended. May be a little lumpy. Chill in fridge about 45 minutes
  until thickened. Fold in chopped cherries.

  In separate small bowl, place whip cream, powdered sugar, and lemon peel. Whip
  until stiff with mixer: use clean beaters. Fold in 1~\T lemon juice and miracle
  whip. Stir cream layer into cranberry layer using a mixer on low setting. Pour into
  lightly oiled jello mold or bowl and freeze.

  In the original recipe, they froze the cranberry layer and then added the
  cream layer and froze it, but Grandma Schermer never did it that way.
