  \begin{ingredients2}
    8 \oz & maraschino cherries\\
    16 \oz& jellied cranberry sauce\\
    3 \oz & cherry jello\\
    4 \T & lemon juice\\
    1 \cup & heavy cream\\
    3 \T & powdered sugar\\
    \fourth \t & lemon peel\\
    \third \cup & Light Miracle Whip
  \end{ingredients2}

  Keep syrup from cherries, chop cherries and set aside. Add water to syrup to make
  1\half~cups of liquid. Boil in the microwave and then add jello. Stir to dissolve.

  In large mixing bowl place jello mix. Add cranberry sauce and 3~\T of the lemon
  juice. Mix together with a spoon. May be a little lumpy. Chill in fridge about 45
  minutes until thickened. 

  In separate bowl, place whip cream, powdered sugar, and lemon peel. Whip until
  stiff with mixer. Gently mix in 1~\T lemon juice and miracle whip. Stir cream layer
  and chopped cherries into cranberry layer using a spoon. Pour into lightly oiled
  jello mold or bowl and freeze.

  In the original recipe, they froze the cranberry layer and then added the
  cream layer and froze it, but Grandma Schermer never did it that way.
