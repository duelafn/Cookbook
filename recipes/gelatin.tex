  \begin{ingredients2}
    1 packet & gelatin\\
    2 \cups & fruit juice
  \end{ingredients2}
  Bloom gelatin 5 minutes in about \half~cup cold juice. Boil 1\half~cups
  juice and pour over gelatin, stir until dissolved. Cool and eat.

  \begin{note}
    2~cups of fruit juice contains about \fourth~cup sugar, any flavored
    liquid with comparable sugar content (or even different sugar content)
    would work fine. Other ideas: vanilla water (tastes like flat cream
    soda), tea, coffee, soda pop, water-dilluted jelly\dots
