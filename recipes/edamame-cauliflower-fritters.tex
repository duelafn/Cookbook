  \begin{ingredients2}
    10 \oz & corn\\
    16 \oz & edamame\\
    10 \oz & riced cauliflower\\
    1\half \c & flour\\
    1\half \c & water\\
    & ginger\\

    & pepper
  \end{ingredients2}

  Thaw veggies and mix everything together. I like lots of ginger and just
  a small sprinkling of curry powder.

  Heat frying pan with a couple tablespoons of oil to 350\degF, then reduce
  to about 25\% heat for frying. Cook 3 at a time in a 9\inch frying pan
  until golden-brown and delicious.
