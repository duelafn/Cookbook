  \begin{ingredients2}
    1 \oz & fat\\
    1 \oz & flour\\
    1 \cup & liquid
  \end{ingredients2}

  Cook fat and flour for 5 minutes for a ``white roux''. Cook longer for a
  darker roux more flavor, but reduced thickening power, up to 1 hour.
  After roux cooked, add liquid and bring to boil. Additional cooking is
  not necessary, but may cook for 30--60 minutes for a smoother gravy.

  Add sausage and pepper for biscuits and gravy.
