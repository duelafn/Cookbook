  Simmer lowfat buttermilk and a splash of whipping cream and add several
  cloves of garlic in a sauce pan (about \fourth~\cup per {pound} of
  potato). Cook on low about 15 minutes --- do not boil --- CONSTANT
  VIGILANCE.

  Alternatively: Don't bother with cooking the dairy. After draining
  potatoes, throw in a couple tablespoons of butter and instead of
  buttermilk and cream, just use plain old cold milk.

  Use mixture of russets and red potatoes. Peel about half of the potatoes.
  Put in pot and fill with hot tap water just to top of potatoes. Add salt
  (several large pinches) cover and bring to boil on high, but do not allow
  to come to full rolling boil (else will water-log). Potatoes should be
  ready after a few minutes at low boil.

  Drain potatoes, add pepper and check saltiness. Mash and add dairy
  mixture in a few batches. Don't overdo mashing or liquid.
