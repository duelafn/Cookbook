  \section{Cake}
  Butter and flour the cake pan.

  Measure dry ingredients into a bowl. Beat egg yolks and \threefourth~\c
  sugar until fluffy and light in color. Fold into the dry ingredients.

  Wash mixing bowl and then beat egg whites and rest of sugar until stiff
  (but not dry) peaks form (soft peaks work fine too). Gently fold the
  whites into the batter in 3 or 4 installments.

  Pour into pan and push batter out to edges to avoid hump in middle. Bake
  30 minutes at \tempF[195]{350}.

  Wait to cool (minimum 2 hours).

  \section{Leche}
  Puncture the cake all over with skewers or a fork. Stir together milks
  and half-and-half and pour all over the cooled cake.

  Let rest (minimum 30 minutes).

  \section{Topping}
  Whip cream and sugar until firm and spread on the cake.
