  French-influenced Vietnamese. A traditional sausage is ``Chả lụa'': lean
  pork, potato starch, garlic, ground black pepper, and fish sauce. We use
  Ekrich turkey sausage, but ham, cold cuts, pulled pork, anything will do.

  Suggestion: Fry 1 package of Ekrich turkey sausage with a large thumb of
  ginger until crispies form. deglaze pan with a splash of fish sauce.

  Cut carrots and daikon into matchsticks, soak in sweetened vinegar for a
  bit. Mix chili sauce and lime juice with mayo. Slice cucumber into thin
  strips. Toast bread. Put it all on the sandwich and eat.
