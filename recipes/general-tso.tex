    1 \cup & chicken stock\\
    2 \T & soy sauce\\

    3 cloves & garlic\\

    \fourth \cup & sugar
  \end{ingredients2}

  Start rice, broccoli, and nuggets cooking (bake until crispy which is probably
  longer than directed on the nugget package). Stir chicken stock through corn starch
  in a bowl and set aside. Chop garlic and ginger. When nuggets are almost done, fry
  garlic and ginger in a bit of oil in frying pan or wok until fragrant. Stir starchy
  liquid and add to pan. Cook on medium-high until thickened. Immediately add cooked
  nuggets. Serve with rice and broccoli.

  Local changes: We use Dino Buddies chicken nuggets, hence the recipe name. 2~spoons
  ginger juice in the liquids instead of fresh, 1~\T Sunny's Teriyaki instead of
  hoisin.
