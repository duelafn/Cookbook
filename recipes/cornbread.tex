  \begin{ingredients2}
    \threefourth \cup & coarse ground cornmeal\\
    \half \cup & regular/fine cornmeal\\
    \fourth \cup & whole wheat flour\\
    \half \cup & all-purpose flour\\
    2\half \t & baking powder\\
    2 \T & sugar\\
    \threefourth \t & salt\\
    2 & eggs\\
    2\half \T & butter (in batter)\\
    1 \cup & milk
  \end{ingredients2}

  Place cast iron skillet with 1~\T peanut oil in oven (also place lid in
  oven, but not on pan) and preheat both to 425\degF (pan takes longer to
  heat than oven).

  Warm butter and half~cup milk to melt. Temper the eggs with the warm
  liquid, then mix in the rest of the milk.

  Stir together dry ingredients then add in wet ingredients. When pan
  reaches temperature or oil in pan starts to smoke, remove pan, pour
  batter into hot pan, then return to oven and cover with hot lid. Turn
  oven down to 350\degF and bake 20 minutes.

  \begin{note}
    Mix wet and dry ingredients as soon as you start warming the pan for
    softer bread. Mix just before pouring into hot pan for extra crispy
    (coarse cornmeal will remain crispy -- very tasty).
