  \section{Oven}
  Poke holes in potato with fork. Rub small amount of peanut oil over
  potato and sprinkle with salt. Bake about 1 hour \tempF[210]{350}
  directly on oven rack. Skin feels crisp but flesh beneath feels soft.

  \section{Microwave + Oven}
  Same preparation as above, but start in microwave for 3--4 minutes, then
  move to oven to finish.

  \section{Grill}
  Slice potatoes long-wise into large wedges (4--6 per potato). Coat in
  peanut oil and sprinkle with salt. Throw onto grill in medium heat areas
  and cook until done.

  \section{Potato Fries}
  Cut up potatoes into cubes or whatever. Heat oven to 400\degF and while
  warming up, place pan with small amount of butter in for a few minutes to
  melt the butter. Add potates to pan and mix to coat potatoes with butter.
  Bake 15 mintes, stir and add salt and pepper. Back in oven and pull out
  when golden brown and delicious.
