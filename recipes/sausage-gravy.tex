  \begin{ingredients2}
    28 \g  & sausage fat\\
    28 \g  & flour\\
    1 \cup & milk\\
    1 \lb  & breakfast sausage
  \end{ingredients2}

  In frying pan, add flour to hot fat. Cook 5 min for a ``white roux'' up
  to an hour for a ``brick roux''. The darker the roux, the more flavor,
  but less thickening power it has (so use less liquid). For a very dark
  roux, a vegetable oil should be used instead of grease.

  Slowly add liquid to the roux, incorporating gully before moving to next
  dose. Bring to just the boiling point. Immediately ready, or else cook
  30--60 minutes for a smoother gravy.
