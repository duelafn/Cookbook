  \begin{ingredients2}
    2 \cups & plain yogurt\\
    2 cloves & garlic\\
    1 & cucumber\\
    3 \T & olive oil\\
    1 \t & salt
  \end{ingredients2}

  Prepare the tzaziki at least a few hours before serving to allow flavors
  to blend.

  Line a colander or sieve with cheesecloth and set it over a bowl. Pour in
  the yogurt and allow it to drip for an hour or so. Peel and grate the
  cucumber, mince the garlic, and combine with drained yogurt. Cover and
  refrigerate until just before serving. To serve: drizzle the olive oil
  over the surface, and without stirring, sprinkle on the salt. It needs no
  mixing.
