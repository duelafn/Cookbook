  \begin{ingredients2}
    1 \lb & shrimp\\
    14 \oz & lobster tails (4)\\
    8 \T & butter\\
    & paprika\\
    & garlic\\
    & lemon (opt)
  \end{ingredients2}

  Over medium heat, fry garlic briefly, then reduce to low heat and melt
  butter with garlic. Remove to a bowl.

  Season shrimp with paprika and fry in a hot pan with some garlic (3--5
  min).

  Use shears to cut lobster tail shells in half \textsl{leaving meat
    intact} and stopping at the tail. Place in hot pan cut side up. Add
  splash of water and cover to steam. Cook until slightly opaque and almost
  cooked through (3 min). Spoon half the garlic butter onto the meat (into
  the shells). Cook until opaque and cooked through (1 min more). Sprinkle
  with lemon zest.

  Chop tails in half lengthwise (along already-cut shells) for serving.
  Toss shrimp in remaining garlic butter.
