  \begin{ingredients2}
    1 \oz & fresh basil\\
    4 \oz & cilantro (large bunch)\\
    3 cloves & garlic (medium cloves)\\
    \half \cup & pine nuts\\
    \threefourth \cup & smoked Gouda\\
    2--3 \T & olive oil\\
    2 \lb & pasta cooked and \textsl{cooled}
  \end{ingredients2}

  Start chopping garlic and third of leaves, add a third more leaves, add
  rest of leaves. Chop in half pine nuts, then rest, then half the cheese,
  then rest. Pack into bowl and add olive oil (it will soak in slowly).
  Toss with pasta. Takes a \textsl{lot} of chopping --- if you use a food
  processor, be \textsl{very} careful not to over-chop (very short bursts).

  A more traditional mix would use all basil and parmesan, but we greatly
  prefer it this way. Be sure pasta is cooled before mixing, else cheese
  will just melt into a blob.
