  \end{ingredients2}

  Gochujang is a sweetened and spiced fermeted bean paste. In a pinch, some sriracha,
  sesame oil, rice vinegar, dashi, and sugar or maple syrup can be used (hoisin sauce
  is primarily fermeted soybean paste so you still will be getting that flavor).

  Toss shredded carrots with vinegar and 2~\t sugar. Microwave 1 minute or so to
  slightly soften and hasten the pickling process.

  Brown zucchini, beef, garlic, and ginger. Stir in sauces and stock. Once cooked
  through, remove from heat and add lemon zest.

  Serve wrapped in lettuce and garnished with (drained) carrots.
