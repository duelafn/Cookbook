  ``Cut'' butter into dry ingredients (with hands until butter fully incorporated --
  no butter lumps). Stir in milk sugar and vanilla (dough will be very moist).

  Cover and refrigerate dough for half an hour.

  Cut peaches and stir with lime juice, sugar, and corn starch.

  Butter a $9\inch\times13\inch$ baking pan, drop about a third of the biscuit dough
  in heaping tablespoon sized balls of around the bottom of the pan. Pour in the
  peaches, then drop the rest of the dough on top. Sprinkle a light coating of sugar
  across the top to help the dough crisp up.

  Bake 60 minutes at 375\degF. Let rest for 15 minutes after baking.
