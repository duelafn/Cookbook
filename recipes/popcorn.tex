  % Original recipe called for twice the goop to popcorn ratio but I misread it. The
  % lower ratio is pretty good and might be better (or at worst increase by 50%).
  %
  Pop popcorn. Heat sugars and water in small sauce pan to 260\degF. Once temperature
  reached, stir in butter, vanilla, and salt. Drizzle over popcorn as someone else
  shakes in a l;arge bowl or pan.
