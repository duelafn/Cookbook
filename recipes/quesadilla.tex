    2 & poblano\\
    6 \T & sour cream\\
    8 \T & cream cheese\\
    4 \t & hot sauce\\
    1\fourth \lb & ground beef\\
    4--8 & tortilla\\
    1 \cup & cheddar cheese
  \end{ingredients2}

  Combine dairy and hot sauce with 2~\t water and microwave 20 seconds to soften.
  Cook poblano in oil for 2--3 minutes then add beef. Cook and drain. Smear tortillas
  (how many depends on size) with cream sauce, sprinkle beef, sprinkle cheddar, fold
  in half. Grill in a clean pan with butter.

  \begin{variant}
    Fry some chicken thighs in \reciperef{Blackening Seasoning} then, after resting,
    slice instead of ground beef.

    Instead of hot sauce, just mix some smoky paprika with the sour cream.

    Instead of chessar cheese use combination of pepper-jack and plain Monterey jack
    --- half and half or some other ratio depending on how spicy you want.
  \end{variant}
