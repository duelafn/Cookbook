  Equal parts rice and liquid. Warm rice in microwave if cold and warm milk
  to lukewarm. Wisk eggs and sugar and slowly add warm milk into egg
  mixture. Whip liquids and stir in rice. Mash the mixture with hands if
  rice is not fresh. Bake at \tempF{325} for 45 minutes -- sides should be
  firming up, but top center will still be runny. Stir a bit to prevent
  surface scum and rest 30 minutes.
