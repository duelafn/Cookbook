  \begin{ingredients2}
    1 & small onion\\
    3 \T & butter\\
    1 & poblano\\
    2 cloves & garlic\\
    1\half \cups & whole milk\\
    1 \lb & cheese\\
    & lime zest (opt)
  \end{ingredients2}

  Grate cheese or cut into small cubes. Traditional cheese is, of course, queso
  blanco, a farmer's cheese, but monterey jack or white american cheese will work
  fine.

  Finely dice the onion and poblano. Fry onion in some onion until caramelized. Add
  poblano cook a bit, then add butter and garlic.

  Meanwhile, bring milk just to a boil (in microwave or another pan). Slowly add
  grated cheese to milk incorporating each batch before starting on the next. Once
  enough cheese has been incorporated you should be able to add to pan of onions and
  peppers and apply a low heat to keep the temperature up if needed.

  Sprinke lime zest on top and eat!
