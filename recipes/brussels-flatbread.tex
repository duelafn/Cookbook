  \begin{ingredients}
    \mbox{} & \reciperef{Pizza Crust}\\
    1 \lb & brussels sprouts\\
    1 \T & italian seasoning\\
    6 cloves & garlic\\
    \half \cup & butter\\
    \fourth \lb & mozzarella\\
    \fourth \lb & smoked gouda\\
    \half \cup & parmesan
  \end{ingredients}

  Start the crust rising. Melt butter and stir in spices and garlic. Shred the
  sprouts and cheeses. Drizzle butter and spices onto crust, sprinkle half the cheese
  below and half the cheese above the brussels sprouts. Bake 10--15 minutes at 475\degF.

  \begin{variant}
    Original recipe used 8~\oz Ricotta cheeze with italian seasoning and zest and
    half the juice of 1 lemon for a base instead of the garlic butter. It also
    provided a hot honey (sriracha) drizzle for the final serving. We didn't like
    that variant very much.
